## Soundfull App
Soundfull helps you download sounds from the internet.

## Why is it on Github
I tried to submitt it to App Stroe. but since it's downloading Audio and Videos from the internet; it was rejected by Apple since it's against Apple Policy. So why not give something back to the open commuinity.

## Features

- download audio file by pasting direct link.
- convert video by pasting direct link to a video and Soundfull will convert it to audio.
- play sounds in background.
- play sounds offline.
- download a sound and rest back and Soundfull will let you know when it has finished.
- share musics you downloaded directly.
- favourite your sounds, and sort them based on your favourites.

## Known Issue:
- The App does not verify that the content it's downloading is audio or video.
- The App crashes when playing an audio finishes and you press the play button.


## Technology
- NSURLSession for downloading media
- File System. e.g. create a directory, save files and retrieve files.
- CoreData. used through Magical Record.
- and ofcourse written in Swift <3


## Installing
You need Xcode 7.3 or 7.3.1 to run this App.
Download and unzip the file. open Soundfull.xcworkspace. then hit Run.
